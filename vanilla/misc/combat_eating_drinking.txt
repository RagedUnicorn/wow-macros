# @description This macro will be checking whether the player currently has the drinking buff and depending on this
# use a different action. The goal of this macro is to have a single button for both eating and drinking. In this example
# action 48 would be drinking and action 36. On first click drinking would start and on second click eating would be starting.
# Note: It is important to recognize that depending on the water level the icon can have a different name
#
# Conjure Water Rank 1 - Interface\\Icons\\INV_Drink_07
# Conjure Water Rank 2 - Interface\\Icons\\INV_Drink_07
# Conjure Water Rank 3 - Interface\\Icons\\INV_Drink_07
# Conjure Water Rank 3 - Interface\\Icons\\INV_Drink_07
# Conjure Water Rank 4 - Interface\\Icons\\INV_Drink_07
# Conjure Water Rank 5 - Interface\\Icons\\INV_Drink_07
# Conjure Water Rank 6 - Interface\\Icons\\INV_Drink_07
# Conjure Water Rank 7 - Interface\\Icons\\INV_Drink_18
#
# Note the macro can be switched around if you prefer using eating first and then drinking. Once both actions are running the macro will always execute the second action if
# the player repeatedly hits the macro. For food the icon will always be the same - Interface\\Icons\\INV_Misc_Fork&Knife

# Drinking first - Spammable eating
/run local i,x=1,0 while UnitBuff("player",i) do if UnitBuff("player",i)=="Interface\\Icons\\INV_Drink_18" then x=1 end i=i+1 end if x==0 then UseAction(48) else UseAction(36) end
