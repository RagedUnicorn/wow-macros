# @description Combination of normal shooting bow or gun with canceling skull of impending
# doom and reequipping weapon into offhand. The intention of this macro is mostly to save an extra
# shortcut for canceling the flee aura. With this macro one can still use his normal shooting shortcut
# and additionally it will cancel the flee aura and reequip the weapon into the offhand.
# Note that equipping of the Mainhand in this macro is optional and can be removed if you don't want it.
